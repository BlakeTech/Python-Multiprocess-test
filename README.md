# Python-Multiprocess-test
Python Web Multiprocess test - Multiprocessing, Threading, Asyncio.

Command is "time ./Multiprocessing x > filename"

x can be 3 options, Multiprocessing, Asyncio, Threading as 1,2,3 respectively.

You will need to add in the start, end and varaible source manually into the code, top three variables.

This script expects you to run it in a terminal, so it just outputs the result. Replace filename with the name of the file you want the result to be stored in.

The purpose of this script is to allow you to test, given a list of urls, which would operate the fastest. Though, the libraries themselves should already dictate that. So consider this more of a rough example as to how to use the varying methods. By no means is any of the code here to be considered gospel.

Asyncio is not working quite right on my environment. Take that part with a large grain of salt.
